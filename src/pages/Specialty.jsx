          Now that we have learned about basics in what coffee is and how it's
          processed, we can explain what specialty coffee means. When you come
          across a specialty coffee shop, they are apart of the third wave in
          coffee. Third wave coffee focuses on making quality their highest
          priority. Quoted from SCA's website "This is not the work of only one
          person in the lifecycle of a coffee bean; specialty can only occur
          when all of those involved in the coffee value chain work in harmony
          and maintain a keen focus on standards and excellence from start to
          finish." Specialty coffee beans are typically graded 80 and above on a
          100 point scale. Most shops try to aim a little higher of serving
          coffees that are only scored 85 or more.

        <h2>Coffee Farmer</h2>
        <p>
          Specialty coffee farmers value quality over quantity. They spend all
          of their time perfecting the way the coffee bean is grown and ensure
          the highest quality. Only coffee beans with no defects and picked at
          the peak of ripeness continue on to the next set of hands. The
          relationship between farmers and cafes is so important. Specialty
          coffee shops want to not only provide the highest quality and care to
          its customers, but they also want to provide that to the farmer as
          well. Specialty shops try to pay a higher price for coffee to ensure
          that farmers have a living wage to support their farm and family. Not
          only that, but they also try to create a lasting relationship that is
          valued and benefits both parties involved.
        </p>
        <h2>Cafe</h2>
        <p>
          Once the coffee gets to a Specialty Coffee Shop, it is transferred to
          the green coffee buyer who, like a sommelier, brews it in small
          quantites to ensure the quality and score (referred to as cupping in
          the coffee world). Once the coffee is analyzed and its of quality, the
          green coffee buyer will develop and determine tasting notes for the
          coffee and relay that to the roaster and cafe staff. The roaster will
          then create a roast profile for each coffee bean, using their skilled
          expertise. Once it is roasted, it is cupped again for quality to
          confirm that the roast brings out the best in the coffee. Once the
          coffee beans reach the retail environment, it has gone through 3
          levels of inspection to ensure the highest quality.

          As you can see, there is a lot that happens behind the scenes before
          the coffee reaches the consumer. This is also severely simplified to
          keep it concise and easy to read, there is so much more that goes into
          ensuring the quality of the coffee. I hope you can see how much love,
          care and attention each person in the coffee life-cycle gives to
          provide the best cup of coffee for you. Specialty coffee is
          revolutionizing the world, while trying to instill more ethical
          practices that benefit the greater good of the coffee world. Next time
          you have a cup of coffee, think about the lifecycle involved to get
          that coffee into your hands. Coffee is truly something special and it
          is the perfect opportunity to be filled with gratitude and feel
          connected to the world around us.
